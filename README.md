# Terraform Learning Labs
# This repo was created while following the **Lauro Ifalho Muller** Terraform course.  

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey with Terraform,
covering core concepts such as providers, data sources, IAM, modules,
state management, and workspaces.

The goal of this repo is foundational understanding.
Production-grade implementations are showcased in separate repositories.
